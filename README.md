### Overview
This is my take on a simple to-do list, the main difference is that it is meant to help you split bigger problems 'Goals' into smaller 
more achievable 'Tasks' which then can be broken down into even smaller 'subtasks'. 

Once you have created your Goals it will keep track of what task have been comleted, if all subtasks in a given task have been completed 
that task will then be marked as completed.

### Set up
1. Run `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies
2. Start the JSON server by entering `json-server --watch ./database/database.json --port 3000` into a terminal
3. Open a new terminal and run `npm run dev` to start the server
